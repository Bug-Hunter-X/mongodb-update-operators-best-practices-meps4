# Incorrect $inc Operator Usage in MongoDB Update

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB update operations involving the `$inc` operator. The error arises from providing a string value to `$inc` instead of a number, resulting in an unexpected outcome.

## Bug Description
The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field in a MongoDB document. However, if a string value is provided as the increment amount, it will not correctly increment the counter. This often leads to silent failures or unexpected data.

## How to Reproduce
1. Set up a MongoDB database.
2. Create a collection named `myCollection` with a document containing a numerical field like `count`.
3. Execute the provided incorrect update query using the `$inc` operator with a string value.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior, likely a failure to increment the `count` field as expected.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the value provided to the `$inc` operator is a number, not a string. This requires correcting the data type of the increment value in the update query.
